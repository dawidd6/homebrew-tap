This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for software that I wrote and not.

Binary bottles are built by the courtesy of Github Actions and are currently available only for Linux on `x86_64` and macOS 10.14.
### Install

Installing any package from this tap is easy, as it usually is:

```sh
brew install dawidd6/tap/$PACKAGE
```

### Contributing

If you want to contribute, please submit a PR. I will be more than happy to review it and eventually merge it!
