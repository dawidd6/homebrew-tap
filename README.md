# Homebrew tap

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for software that I wrote and not.

Everything in this repository is free to grab, no license.

Only Linux is tested and bottled currently.

### Usage

Installing any package from this tap is easy, as it usually is:

```sh
brew install tedim52/tap/FORMULA
```
