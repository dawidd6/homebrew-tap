# Homebrew tap

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for software that I wrote and not.

Binary bottles are currently available only for `x86_64_linux` and `catalina`.

Everything in this repository is free to grab, no license.

### Usage

Installing any package from this tap is easy, as it usually is:

```sh
brew install dawidd6/tap/FORMULA
```
